   - **Goal:** Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using architectures like RNN, LSTM, and GRU.
   - **Approach:** Implemented different models, evaluated their performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and determined the most optimal model for sentiment classification.

5. **[Task Five: Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews üé¨](https://github.com/OmarEsmat/Internship-Deep-Learning-Experience/tree/master/tasks/5-Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20IMDB%20Movie%20Reviews)**
   - **Goal:** Conduct sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews to predict sentiments using deep learning models.
   - **Approach:** Preprocessed the dataset, tokenized reviews, and experimented with different architectures (RNN, LSTM, GRU).

6. **[Task Six: Question Answering using BERT ‚ùì](https://github.com/OmarEsmat/Internship-Deep-Learning-Experience/tree/master/tasks/6--Question%20Answering%20using%20bert)**
   - **Goal:** Build a question-answering system using BERT on the SQuAD dataset.
   - **Approach:** Used pre-trained BERT (`distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`), fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset, and addressed challenges like tokenization and answer position mapping.
